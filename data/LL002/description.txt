The first astronaut to land on the moon may need an eye in the back of his head, and a new "Electrocular" headset (right) perfected by Hughes Aircraft may well provide it. The headset contains a miniature cathode-ray tube (A) to receive, say, a closed-circuit TV picture, as well as an internal mirror (B) to "bend" the image toward the viewing eyepiece (C). A microphone (D) for voice communications is optional. Since the monocle-type eye-piece is a transparent mirror, the wearer can look through the image, when necessary, to concentrate on what is actually in front of him. The apparent size of the image (up to eight feet in diameter) varies according to where he focuses his eyes. Many other applications are anticipated for the new device - it's being used by the pilot at left, for example, to receive pictured information from the control tower on air traffic and ground conditions.
