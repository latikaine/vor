The Sony Glasstron was a family of portable head-mounted displays, first released in 1996 with the model PLM-50.[1][2] The products included two LCD screens and two earphones for video and audio respectively. These products are no longer manufactured nor supported by Sony.[citation needed]
The Glasstron was not the first head-mounted display by Sony, with the Visortron being a previous exhibited unit.[3][4] The Sony HMZ-T1, HMZ-T2, HMZ-T3 and PlayStation VR can be considered successors to Glasstron.[2]
One application of this technology was in the game MechWarrior 2, which permitted users to adopt a visual perspective from inside the cockpit of the craft, using their own eyes as visual and seeing the battlefield through their craft's own cockpit.[5]
